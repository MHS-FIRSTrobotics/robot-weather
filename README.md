# Summer Of Code Challenges
If you (or your team) want to work on this, here is a list of things you could be. We want other people to try new things and play with other code.
[ ] Write a tornado detection system on this
[ ] Take into account how pneumatics are affected by the weather
[ ] Use an weather API to cover other places
[ ] Design a better way to tell if the weather is awesome (or rainy, cold, dreary, and just blah in mature)

Pull requests for people wanting to submit their ideas for doing that will not be merged until after Imagine This Contest 4 results are published.

Best of luck to all the Imagine This Challenge 4 Teams,
    FTC 5395, Team Clutch
